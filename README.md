This project focuses on building a speech recognition model to predict dialects of the Gujarati language. Using 13 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), the system extracts compact and meaningful features representing the speech signal. Data augmentation techniques such as time stretching, pitch shifting, noise injection, and temporal shifting were applied to enhance the model's robustness and generalization. The extracted features were used to train a machine learning model, achieving significant accuracy in distinguishing Gujarati dialects, demonstrating the effectiveness of MFCC features and augmentation techniques.
